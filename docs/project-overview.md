# JobGenie: Your Job Search Assistant - Simple Explanation

## What is JobGenie? üßû‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
JobGenie is your personal job search assistant that brings together job listings from multiple platforms like Shine and Naukri in one place. It helps you find the perfect job opportunities and manage your professional profile efficiently.

## How is it Built? üèóÔ∏è
JobGenie is split into two main parts that work together:

### 1. Frontend (What You See) üëÄ
This is the website you interact with in your browser. It's built with modern technology called React that makes websites interactive and fast. Here's what you can do:

- **Search for Jobs**: A smart search system with filters to find the right jobs
- **Build Your Profile**: Create and manage your professional profile
- **Create Resumes**: Build and manage your resumes

For example, when you search for jobs, it looks like this:

### 2. Backend (Behind the Scenes) üîß
This is like the engine of JobGenie that:
- Aggregates and stores job listings from multiple job portals
- Maintains your professional profile
- Keeps your data safe with secure login
- Processes your searches and filters
- Manages your resume data

## How They Work Together ü§ù

1. **When You Search for Jobs:**
   - You type what you're looking for in the frontend
   - The backend searches through thousands of jobs
   - The frontend shows you the results instantly

2. **When You Login:**
   - Frontend collects your username/password
   - Backend checks if it's correct
   - If valid, you get access to your personal dashboard

## Security & Privacy üîí
Your data is protected by:
- Secure password storage
- Protected login system
- Safe data transmission
- Regular security checks

## Smart Features üéØ
- **Multi-Platform Job Search**: Access jobs from Shine, Naukri, and other platforms in one place
- **Job Matching**: Suggests jobs based on your profile
- **Profile Completion**: Helps you build a stronger profile step by step
- **Smart Search**: Finds relevant jobs quickly across all platforms

### Example: How Job Search Works Behind the Scenes
Here's a simplified look at how JobGenie handles job searches and saves (with explanatory comments):

```typescript
// This code runs when you search for jobs
const searchForJobs = async (searchParams) => {
    // Send your search to the backend
    const response = await api.get('/jobs', { searchParams });
    // Return the matched jobs
    return response.data;
};

// This code runs when you click "Save Job"
const saveJobForLater = async (jobId) => {
    // Store the job in your saved list
    await api.post('/user/saved-jobs', { jobId });
};

// This code shows your saved jobs
const viewSavedJobs = async () => {
    // Get your list of saved jobs
    const response = await api.get('/user/saved-jobs');
    return response.data;
};
```

This is a simplified version of the actual code that powers these features. When you use JobGenie:
1. Your search terms are sent to the backend
2. The backend finds matching jobs
3. The results appear on your screen
4. You can save interesting jobs with one click
