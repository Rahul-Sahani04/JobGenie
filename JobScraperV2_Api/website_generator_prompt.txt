Create a beautiful, user-friendly, and easy-to-navigate website for job seekers. The website should consume a REST API to display job postings.

**Website Features:**

*   **Homepage:** A visually appealing landing page with a clear call to action (e.g., "Find Your Dream Job").
*   **Job Search:**
    *   A prominent search bar that allows users to search for jobs by keywords (title, description), location, and platform.
    *   Filters for refining search results (e.g., job type, experience level, salary range).
    *   Display search results in a clean and organized manner, with clear job titles, company names, locations, and brief descriptions.
*   **Job Details Page:**
    *   A dedicated page for each job posting, displaying all relevant information (title, company, location, description, requirements, salary, application link).
*   **User Profiles:**
    *   User registration and login functionality.
    *   User profiles where job seekers can:
        *   Save job postings.
        *   Manage their job search preferences.
        *   Upload their resume.
*   **API Integration:**
    *   The website should consume the following API endpoints:
        *   `/jobs`: To search and retrieve job postings based on search criteria (keywords, location, platform).
            *   Example usage: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/jobs?query=software%20engineer&location=Bangalore`
        *   `/all_jobs`: To retrieve a limited number of all job postings. The limit can be set using the `limit` parameter.
            *   Example usage: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/all_jobs?limit=20`
    *   The website should handle API responses gracefully, displaying appropriate messages for errors or empty results.
*   **Design and Aesthetics:**
    *   A modern and professional design with a focus on usability.
    *   A responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
    *   Use a visually appealing color scheme and typography.
*   **Technology Stack (Suggestions):**
    *   Frontend: React, Angular, Vue.js, or plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
    *   Backend (if needed for user profiles): Node.js, Python (Flask/Django).

**Overall Goal:**

Create a website that provides a seamless and efficient job search experience for users, leveraging the power of the job aggregation API. The website should be visually appealing, easy to use, and provide all the necessary features for job seekers to find their ideal roles.
