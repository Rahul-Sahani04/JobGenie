Chapter 4
Testing & Implementation

4.1.1 Unit Testing
Unit testing was extensively performed throughout the development cycle using Jest for testing React components and Mocha for Node.js modules. This approach ensured that individual components like JobCard, SearchBar, and authentication functions were thoroughly tested for functionality and compatibility.

4.1.2 Module Testing
Module testing focused on validating the interactions between related components and functions. We used mocks and stubs to simulate external dependencies and assess the seamless integration of modules within the system. This included testing the job search module, application tracking system, and user profile management.

4.1.3 Integration Testing
Integration testing was conducted to verify the cohesive functioning of the integrated system. Tools like Cypress were employed for end-to-end testing, ensuring that different components worked harmoniously to deliver a seamless user experience. This included testing the complete job application flow and user authentication process.

4.1.4 System Testing
Comprehensive system testing was carried out in a production-like environment to assess the system's compliance with specified requirements. Functional, performance, security, and usability aspects were rigorously tested to ensure the system met user expectations and handled real-world scenarios effectively.

4.1.5 White Box / Black Box Testing
A combination of white box and black box testing approaches was employed. White box testing, including code reviews and static analysis, provided insights into internal code structure and logic. Black box testing, focusing on external behavior and inputs, ensured the system's functionality from a user perspective.

4.2 Test Data & Test Cases

1. User Login
Test Case: Verify that users can successfully log in using valid credentials.
Expected Result: User should be logged in and directed to the job search dashboard.

2. Job Search
Test Case: Verify that users can search and filter jobs effectively.
Expected Result: System should return relevant job listings matching search criteria.

3. Application Submission
Test Case: Verify that users can submit job applications with required documents.
Expected Result: Application should be processed and confirmation received.

4. Profile Management
Test Case: Verify that users can update their professional profiles.
Expected Result: Profile changes should be saved and reflected immediately.

5. Recommendation System
Test Case: Verify that job recommendations are personalized based on user profile.
Expected Result: Recommended jobs should match user skills and preferences.

4.3 Test Reports and Debugging
Regular testing reports were generated showing test coverage, passed/failed cases, and issues identified. Debugging was performed using Chrome DevTools for frontend issues and Node.js debugging tools for backend problems.

4.4 Implementation Manual
Clear documentation was maintained for setting up and running the system:
- Frontend setup with React and TypeScript
- Backend configuration with Node.js
- Database setup with MongoDB
