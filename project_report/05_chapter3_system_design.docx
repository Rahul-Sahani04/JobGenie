Chapter 3
System Design

3.1 Design Methodology

1) Planning: In this stage, the objectives and requirements of JobGenie are defined
and then a project plan is created. This involves conducting user research to understand
job seeker needs and employer requirements. The plan outlines key features like job
search, application tracking, and AI recommendations.

2) Design: In this stage, the visual design and user experience of JobGenie are
developed including the layout and interface components. This includes navigation
structure, job listing cards, search filters, and application forms.

3) Development: In this stage, the platform is built using modern web technologies:
- Frontend: React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- AI Components: Python for job scraping and recommendations
The functionality includes job search, application submission, profile management, and
recommendation systems.

4) Testing: In this stage, comprehensive testing ensures all features work as intended.
This includes:
- Unit testing of components
- Integration testing of APIs
- User acceptance testing
- Performance and security testing

5) Deployment: In this stage, JobGenie is deployed using cloud infrastructure:
- Frontend hosting
- Backend server setup
- Database configuration
- Domain and SSL setup

6) Maintenance: After launch, JobGenie requires ongoing maintenance:
- Regular updates
- Bug fixes
- Performance monitoring
- Feature enhancements

3.2 UML Modelling

3.2.1 Use Case Diagram

Fig 3.2.1 Use Case Diagram
The diagram shows the different actions users can take on JobGenie, including:
- Job seekers searching for jobs
- Submitting applications
- Managing profiles
- Tracking application status
- Employers posting jobs
- Admin managing the platform

3.2.2 Sequence Diagram

Fig 3.2.2 Sequence Diagram
This sequence diagram shows how the job application process works:
1. User searches for jobs
2. System returns matched positions
3. User submits application
4. System processes and tracks status

3.2.3 Activity Diagram

Fig 3.2.3 Activity Diagram
The diagram shows the job search workflow. Users log in, search for jobs using filters,
view job details, and submit applications. The system processes applications and
updates status.

3.2.4 Class Diagram

Fig 3.2.4 Class Diagram
The class diagram shows key system components:
- User class managing profiles
- Job class handling listings
- Application class tracking submissions
- Recommendation engine class

3.3 Database Design
